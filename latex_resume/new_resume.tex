% --- SUMMARY ---
\section{Professional Profile}
Seeking Senior Software Engineer (Backend) roles to build reliable platforms for millions of users globally. 6+ years experience with supply chain visibility at FourKites and fintech products at Grab (microservices, distributed systems, event-driven architecture in Go/Java), plus batch compute platform managing thousands of nodes and batch workloads on Apache stack at Uber.

\section{Professional Experience}

\experienceitem{UBER}{Software Engineer (L4)}{Batch Compute Team}{Bangalore, India}{Oct 2024 -- Present}
{
    \item \textbf{Automated cluster fault isolation:} Implemented a Resilience4j layer on the Apache YARN Router with per-cluster circuit breakers and retries, reducing manual incident MTTR from ~15 minutes to under 60 seconds.

    \item \textbf{Kubernetes admission controls:} Built a ConfigMap-driven admission policy to block low-tier apps during outages, protecting capacity for high-priority workloads (blocked ~7\% of concurrent volume).
    
    \item \textbf{Apache YARN scheduling improvements:} Moved application-id generation to the YARN Router and enforced submission time based ordering, reducing scheduling out-of-order delays by ~20s in smaller clusters.

    \item \textbf{Cluster federation management CLI:} Built an Apache YARN router federation CLI command with Zookeeper-backed runtime state to instantly detach problematic sub-clusters, stop RPCs to unhealthy clusters, and contain incident blast radius.

    \item \textbf{Mitigated host instability:} Implemented strict memory reservations for critical host agents (e.g., SSH) to prevent OOM kills during heavy memory-load from Apache YARN jobs, improving host availability under load.

    \item \textbf{Improved K8s operational visibility:} Enhanced the internal application listing with job-id search and resource-usage shading, reducing operator time-to-debug.

\roleitem{Senior Software Engineer}{Aug 2023 -- Oct 2024}{Lending Core Team}{Bangalore, India}
    \item Contributed to redesigning the loan eligibility processing engine from a bi-weekly batch process to an \textbf{event-driven system triggered by real-time driver activity}. This \textbf{eliminated data lag} and \textbf{redistributed the processing load for millions of drivers across five markets, reducing peak database demand by approximately 30\% and increasing loan product adoption}.
    
    \item Optimized loan creation API performance by implementing \textbf{MySQL batch inserts} for instalment processing, \textbf{reducing p95 latency by 40\%}. The reduction in network round-trips and lock acquisitions \textbf{improved throughput during high-concurrency database writes}. 

    \item Developed a \textbf{scalable data aggregator} consuming 5+ internal APIs to facilitate banking partnerships; optimized for \textbf{sub-second latency} and implemented \textbf{partial response logic} to ensure \textbf{high system availability}.

    \item Enhanced an internal \textbf{retry framework} built on top of a Kafka connector, enabling \textbf{message re-queuing for reprocessing} during application shut-down to \textbf{prevent data loss}.
    
    \item Mentorship: Facilitated \textbf{codebase deep-dives and technical onboarding} for new hires to accelerate team integration.

\roleitem{Software Engineer}{Oct 2021 -- Aug 2023}{PayLater Team}{Bangalore, India}
    \item Designed the \textbf{BNPL Refund API} to support Grab's expansion into Indonesia. Successfully \textbf{scaled the service to 10\% of the country's user base} during the initial launch phase. Integrated \textbf{idempotent design and state machine logic to automate error recovery and complex refund flows}.

    \item Developed a \textbf{tiered service fee engine} for the Indonesia BNPL rollout. Orchestrated changes across \textbf{real-time Charge APIs and batch billing systems to calculate usage-based fees}. Integrated \textbf{slab-rate logic} and ensured fee charges during initial monthly transaction.

    \item Created \textbf{low-level design for a credit risk checker module}, featuring configurability, and developed an API client for \textbf{country specific credit bureau integration}, collaborating with product management and external credit bureau.

    \item Designed and implemented a \textbf{robust lending credit score API}, integrating data from multiple internal services. Drove discussions with internal data-science team and product teams, ensuring \textbf{adherence to API design and security best practices}.

    \item Collaborated in cross-service \textbf{technical debt reduction}, including a Go version migration and \textbf{full go mod adoption}. Improved \textbf{build pipeline speeds by 18\%} and \textbf{reduced container image sizes}. Executed a comprehensive refactor that \textbf{increased unit test coverage by 20\%} and ensured strict \textbf{clean-code adherence}.
    
    \item Awarded \textbf{"The Grab Way Award" in 2023} for engineering excellence in BNPL project.

\experienceitem{FOURKITES INC.}{Software Engineer}{Multimodal Supply Chain Visibility Team}{Chennai, India}{Jun 2019 -- Oct 2021}
{
    \item \textbf{Designed and implemented a scalable API response caching system} for generic tracking data, utilising \textbf{Redis to efficiently store and retrieve responses for 50,000+ ocean shipments} across 10+ ocean carriers. Successfully \textbf{containerized, deployed, and tested} the system. Later adopted by rail and air shipment teams, expanding its use.

    \item \textbf{Designed an asynchronous Kafka-based pipeline} to enrich maritime ETD events by \textbf{integrating distributed microservices into a unified callback payload}, decoupling ingestion from enrichment to ensure \textbf{high-throughput delivery of real-time shipment updates}.

    \item \textbf{Port Address Autocomplete API:} Developed global port autocomplete APIs using \textbf{composite indexing} on various granularity levels to achieve \textbf{sub-second search response times}.

    \item \textbf{Conceptualized and oversaw the development of an internal tool} for creating shipment tracking events, mentoring an intern, and \textbf{boosting QA productivity}. \textbf{Reducing tracking event testing time by ~20mins}.

    \item \textbf{Integrated ocean-specific features into common shipment cloning module} to streamline new client demonstrations. This enhancement enabled tailored, \textbf{domain-specific data replication}, improving the \textbf{accuracy and impact of the sales engineering process}.
