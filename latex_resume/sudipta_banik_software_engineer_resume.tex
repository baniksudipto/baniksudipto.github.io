\section{Work Experience}

\companyheader{UBER}

\roleblock
{Software Engineer II}
{Oct 2024 -- Present}
{Batch Compute Team}
{Bangalore, India}
{
    \item Designed and implemented \textbf{automated fault isolation} for apache distributed job execution system using \textbf{circuit breakers and adaptive retries, reducing incident MTTR to under 60 seconds} and preventing cascading failures across downstream services.

    \item Built a dynamic workload admission control service to protect high-priority jobs during system stress, leveraging Kubernetes ConfigMaps for real-time policy propagation — blocking $\approx 7\%$ of total concurrent job volume.

    \item Improved job scheduling correctness in a distributed execution engine by centralizing ID generation and enforcing submission-time ordering, \textbf{eliminating allocation delays of up to 20 seconds} for ML and data workloads.

    \item Developed a ZooKeeper-backed federation controller for the YARN Router, enabling quick cluster isolation and re-attachment to \textbf{maintain system SLA} during system outages.

    \item Enhanced Uber's internal Kubernetes batch job observability dashboard with workload-type and job-ID search, and a resource-usage heatmap - Improving on-call debuggability and reducing time-to-insight during incidents.

\companyheader{GRAB}

\roleblock
{Senior Software Engineer}
{Aug 2023 -- Oct 2024}
{Lending Core Team, Fintech}
{Bangalore, India}
{
    \item Contributed to designing loan offer and credit limit generation from a monthly batch to real-time event-driven processing, reducing DB load by $\approx 30\%$ across millions of drivers and increasing loan product adoption.
    
    \item Reduced loan creation API p95 latency by almost 32\% via \textbf{MySQL batch inserts} for instalment. The reduction in network round-trips and lock acquisitions \textbf{improved throughput during high-concurrency database writes}. 

    \item Developed a \textbf{sub-second data aggregator API} integrating 5+ internal APIs for banking partners; with \textbf{partial response fallback for high availability}.

    \item Improved Kafka consumer framework reliability via graceful shutdown re-queuing, reducing message loss to near zero across financial transaction pipelines.
    
    \item Mentored 2 new engineers through onboarding, maintaining team velocity during hiring season.
}

\roleblock
{Software Engineer}
{Oct 2021 -- Aug 2023}
{PayLater Team, Fintech}
{Bangalore, India}
{
    \item For Grab's Indonesia PayLater launch, I designed and scaled the \textbf{Refund API} to handle 10\% of the countries user base. Used \textbf{idempotent and state machine design patterns}, automating retries, error recovery and complex refund flows, which handled 3M+ users gracefully.

    \item Built a \textbf{tiered service fee module for real-time charge APIs and batch billing systems}, implementing slab-rate logic per Indonesian regulatory requirements.

    \item Designed a configurable credit risk assessment module, \textbf{collaborating with product teams and external credit bureaus} to integrate country-specific requirements across \textbf{multiple Southeast Asian markets}.

    \item Designed and implemented a \textbf{robust lending credit score API}, integrating score from data-science team models and user metadata teams, ensuring \textbf{adherence to REST API design and security best practices}.

    \item Improved CI/CD build speeds by $\approx 18\%$ and increased unit test coverage by $\approx 35\%$ through Go version migration, go mod adoption, and systematic refactoring following clean code adherence and dependency inversions.

\companyheader{FOURKITES INC.}

\roleblock
{Software Engineer}
{Jun 2019 -- Oct 2021}
{Multimodal Supply Chain Visibility Team}
{Chennai, India}
{
    \item Architected a \textbf{Redis-backed caching layer to enable direct integration} with 10+ global maritime carriers, reducing reliance on costly third-party data providers. Designed carrier-specific configs to comply with \textbf{API rate limits and built end-to-end data parsers and update flows} — later adopted by rail and air teams. \textbf{Guided an intern through task delegation to fast-track delivery}.

    \item Resolved search disruptions by replacing a shared Elasticsearch dependency with a dedicated Port Autocomplete API; utilized \textbf{composite indexing and in-memory caching} for 80,000+ ports to achieve \textbf{sub-100\,ms latency and operational independence}.

    \item \textbf{Designed an async Kafka-based maritime event enrichment pipeline} for ETA/ETD updates by \textbf{integrating data from multiple internal microservices} into a unified callback payload — ensuring event persistence, configurability, and reliable real-time shipment update delivery to customers.

    \item Eliminated error-prone QA processes by replacing SSH-based Ruby script execution with an \textbf{internal shipment event simulation tool} — dropdown-driven UI, event-specific data fields, and background worker integration. Delegated frontend tasks to an intern to fast-track delivery.

    \item Added ocean-specific features to the shipment cloning module, enabling \textbf{domain-specific data replication that improved accuracy and impact} of new client sales demos.
