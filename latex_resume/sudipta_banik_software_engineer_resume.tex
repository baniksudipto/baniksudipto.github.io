\section{Work Experience}

\companyheader{UBER}

\roleblock
{Software Engineer II}
{Oct 2024 -- Present}
{Batch Compute Team}
{Bangalore, India}
{
    \item Designed and implemented \textbf{automated fault isolation} for Apache distributed job execution system using \textbf{circuit breakers and adaptive retries, reducing incident Mean Time To Resolve (MTTR) to under 60 seconds} and preventing cascading failures across downstream services.
    \item Built a dynamic workload admission control service to protect high-priority jobs during system outages, leveraging Kubernetes ConfigMaps for real-time policy propagation and blocking \textasciitilde7\% of total \textasciitilde400K+ concurrent job volume.
    \item Improved job scheduling correctness in a distributed execution engine by centralizing ID generation and enforcing submission-time ordering, \textbf{eliminating allocation delays of up to 20 seconds} for ML and data workloads.
    \item Developed a ZooKeeper-backed federation controller for the Apache YARN Router, enabling quick cluster isolation and re-attachment to \textbf{maintain system Service Level Agreement (SLA)} during system outages.
    \item Enhanced Uber's internal Kubernetes batch job observability dashboard with workload-type and job-ID search, and a resource-usage heatmap - \textbf{Improving on-call debuggability} and reducing time-to-insight during incidents.

\roleblock
{Senior Software Engineer}
{Aug 2023 -- Oct 2024}
{Lending Core Team, Fintech}
{Bangalore, India}
{
    \item Redesigned the loan offer and credit limit generation from a monthly batch job to \textbf{real-time event-driven processing using Kafka}, reducing peak DB load by \textasciitilde30\% and reducing loan offer waiting time for \textbf{millions of drivers}.
    \item Reduced loan creation API p95 latency by almost 32\% via \textbf{MySQL batch inserts} for instalment. The reduction in network round-trips and lock acquisitions \textbf{improved throughput during high-concurrency database writes}. 
    \item Developed a \textbf{sub-second data aggregator API} integrating 5+ internal APIs for banking partners; with \textbf{partial response fallback for high availability}.
    \item \textbf{Improved the internal Kafka consumer framework reliability} via graceful shutdown re-queuing, reducing message loss to near zero across financial transaction pipelines.
    % \item \textbf{Mentored 2 new engineers through onboarding}, maintaining team velocity during hiring season.

\roleblock
{Software Engineer}
{Oct 2021 -- Aug 2023}
{PayLater Team, Fintech}
{Bangalore, India}
{
    \item For Grab's Indonesia PayLater launch, \textbf{designed and scaled} the \textbf{Refund API} to handle 10\% of the country's user base. Used \textbf{idempotent and state machine design patterns}, automating retries, error recovery and complex refund flows, which handled 3M+ users gracefully.
    \item Built a \textbf{tiered service fee module for real-time charge APIs and batch billing systems}, implementing slab-rate logic per Indonesian regulatory requirements.
    \item Designed a configurable credit risk assessment module, \textbf{collaborating with product teams and external credit bureaus} to integrate country-specific requirements across \textbf{multiple Southeast Asian markets}.
    \item Developed a \textbf{robust lending credit score API}, integrating credit score from data-science team models and user metadata services, ensuring \textbf{adherence to REST API design and security best practices}.
    \item Improved CI/CD build speeds by \textasciitilde18\% and increased unit test coverage by \textasciitilde35\% through Go version upgrade, glide to go mod adoption, and systematic refactoring following \textbf{clean code adherence and dependency inversions}.

\companyheader{FOURKITES INC.}

\roleblock
{Software Engineer}
{Jun 2019 -- Oct 2021}
{Multimodal Supply Chain Visibility Team}
{Chennai, India}
{
    \item Architected a \textbf{Redis-backed caching layer to enable direct integration} with 10+ global maritime carriers, reducing reliance on costly third-party data providers. Designed carrier-specific configs to comply with \textbf{API rate limits and built end-to-end data parsers and update flows}, which was later adopted by rail and air teams. 
    \item \textbf{Mentored an intern} on feature implementation and code review process for maritime integration module, accelerating knowledge transfer and team productivity.
    \item Improved \textbf{global address search API availability} by replacing a shared Elasticsearch dependency with a dedicated Port Autocomplete API utilising \textbf{composite SQL indexing and in-memory cache} for 80,000+ ports and achieved \textbf{sub-100ms latency}.
    \item \textbf{Designed an async Kafka-based maritime event enrichment pipeline} for ETA/ETD updates by \textbf{integrating data from multiple internal microservices} into a unified callback payload — ensuring event persistence, configurability, and reliable real-time shipment update delivery to customers.
    \item Eliminated error-prone QA processes by replacing SSH-based Ruby script execution with an \textbf{internal shipment event simulation tool} with dropdown-driven UI, event-specific data fields, and background worker integration. Delegated some tasks to an intern for their learning.
    \item Added ocean-specific features to the shipment cloning module, enabling \textbf{domain-specific data replication that improved accuracy and impact} of new client sales demos.
