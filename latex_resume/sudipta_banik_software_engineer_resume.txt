WORK EXPERIENCE

UBER
Software Engineer II                                                                              Oct 2024 – Present
Batch Compute Team                                                                                  Bangalore, India
• Designed and implemented automated fault isolation for Apache distributed job execution system using
  circuit breakers and adaptive retries, reducing incident Mean Time To Resolve (MTTR) to under 60 seconds
  and preventing cascading failures across downstream services.
• Built a dynamic workload admission control service to protect high-priority jobs during system outages,
  leveraging Kubernetes ConﬁgMaps for real-time policy propagation and blocking ~7% of total ~400K+
  concurrent job volume.
• Improved job scheduling correctness in a distributed execution engine by centralizing ID generation and
  enforcing submission-time ordering, eliminating allocation delays of up to 20 seconds for ML and data
  workloads.
• Developed a ZooKeeper-backed federation controller for the Apache YARN Router, enabling quick cluster
  isolation and re-attachment to maintain system Service Level Agreement (SLA) during system outages.
• Enhanced Uber’s internal Kubernetes batch job observability dashboard with workload-type and job-ID
  search, and a resource-usage heatmap - Improving on-call debuggability and reducing time-to-insight during
  incidents.

GRAB
Senior Software Engineer                                                                      Aug 2023 – Oct 2024
Lending Core Team, Fintech                                                                         Bangalore, India
• Redesigned the loan oﬀer and credit limit generation from a monthly batch job to real-time event-driven
  processing using Kafka, reducing peak DB load by ~30% and reducing loan oﬀer waiting time for millions of
  drivers.
• Reduced loan creation API p95 latency by almost 32% via MySQL batch inserts for instalment. The
  reduction in network round-trips and lock acquisitions improved throughput during high-concurrency
  database writes.
• Developed a sub-second data aggregator API integrating 5+ internal APIs for banking partners; with partial
  response fallback for high availability.
• Improved the internal Kafka consumer framework reliability via graceful shutdown re-queuing, reducing
  message loss to near zero across ﬁnancial transaction pipelines.

PayLater Team, Fintech                                                                             Bangalore, India
• For Grab’s Indonesia PayLater launch, designed and scaled the Refund API to handle 10% of the country’s
  user base. Used idempotent and state machine design patterns, automating retries, error recovery and
  complex refund ﬂows, which handled 3M+ users gracefully.
• Built a tiered service fee module for real-time charge APIs and batch billing systems, implementing slab-
  rate logic per Indonesian regulatory requirements.
• Designed a conﬁgurable credit risk assessment module, collaborating with product teams and external
  credit bureaus to integrate country-speciﬁc requirements across multiple Southeast Asian markets.
• Developed a robust lending credit score API, integrating credit score from data-science team models and
  user metadata services, ensuring adherence to REST API design and security best practices.
• Improved CI/CD build speeds by ~18% and increased unit test coverage by ~35% through Go version
  upgrade, glide to go mod adoption, and systematic refactoring following clean code adherence and
  dependency inversions.

FOURKITES INC.
Software Engineer                                                                        Jun 2019 – Oct 2021
Multimodal Supply Chain Visibility Team                                                        Chennai, India
• Architected a Redis-backed caching layer to enable direct integration with 10+ global maritime carriers,
  reducing reliance on costly third-party data providers. Designed carrier-speciﬁc conﬁgs to comply with
  API rate limits and built end-to-end data parsers and update ﬂows, which was later adopted by rail and air
  teams.
• Mentored an intern on feature implementation and code review process for maritime integration module,
  accelerating knowledge transfer and team productivity.
• Improved global address search API availability by replacing a shared Elasticsearch dependency with a
  dedicated Port Autocomplete API utilising composite SQL indexing and in-memory cache for 80,000+ ports
  and achieved sub-100ms latency.
• Designed an async Kafka-based maritime event enrichment pipeline for ETA/ETD updates by integrating
  data from multiple internal microservices into a uniﬁed callback payload — ensuring event persistence,
  conﬁgurability, and reliable real-time shipment update delivery to customers.
• Eliminated error-prone QA processes by replacing SSH-based Ruby script execution with an internal
  shipment event simulation tool with dropdown-driven UI, event-speciﬁc data ﬁelds, and background worker
  integration. Delegated some tasks to an intern for their learning.
• Added ocean-speciﬁc features to the shipment cloning module, enabling domain-speciﬁc data replication
  that improved accuracy and impact of new client sales demos.
